# Project Proposal for Hackathon 4

## Summary

- To build the core mechanism of a chat application such as the chat thread, the user inputs, and being able to connect to the chat server through a client-side and begin chatting with other users

## Goal

- The following application uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a simple front-end experience, leverages light-weight server-side framework express.js, and the library socket.io to let users chat with each other

## Location

- My own repo

## Requirements

- Create a repo with a scalable JavaScript, HTML, and CSS pattern - express endpoints, socket.io, and use vanilla js for the front-end
- The chat app will begin at a default state giving the user a random username
- The chat application will have API endpoints to GET/SEND/DELETE/EDIT the chat messages
- The UI will be designed using a napkin drawing
- No state to save, but leave endpoints to connect to a NoSQL db like MongoDB
